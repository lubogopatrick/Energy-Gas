 types of gas used in society:

1. *Natural Gas* (NG): Primarily composed of methane, used for heating, cooking, and electricity generation.

2. *Compressed Natural Gas* (CNG): Pressurized natural gas used as a fuel for vehicles.

3. *Liquefied Petroleum Gas* (LPG): A mixture of propane and butane, used for cooking, heating, and as a fuel for vehicles.

4. *Propane*: A byproduct of natural gas processing, used for grilling, cooking, and as a fuel for vehicles.

5. *Butane*: A byproduct of natural gas processing, used as a fuel for lighters, cooking, and heating.

6. *Oxygen* (O2): Used in medical applications, steel production, and water treatment.

7. *Nitrogen* (N2): Used in industrial processes, food packaging, and tire inflation.

8. *Hydrogen* (H2): Used in industrial processes, fuel cells, and as a clean energy source.

9. *Synthetic Gas* (Syngas): A mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, used as a fuel and feedstock for chemical production.

10. *Biogas*: A mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, produced through anaerobic digestion of organic matter, used as a renewable energy source.

11. *Coal Gas*: A mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, produced through coal gasification, used as a fuel and feedstock for chemical production.

12. *Town Gas*: A mixture of hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, produced through coal gasification, used as a fuel for heating and cooking.

These gases have various applications across industries, including energy, transportation, industrial processes, and healthcare.
